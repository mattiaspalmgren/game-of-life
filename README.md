# Game of life

Game of life visualised with system output. 
`*` represents alive cells, and `.` dead ones.

## How to run
Generate and run jar file with the size of the world and initial alive positions as input parameters.
For brevity quadratic worlds are assumed, so the first input argument represents the size of full world. 
 
Example: 
`java -jar NAME.jar 6 1,1 2,1 1,2 4,3 3,4 4,4`
